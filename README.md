# Personal Website

Based on the [jekyll-now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) template
and inspired by [mojombo's site](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io).

## Local Development

To start the local jekyll dev server, run
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
and then open a browser tab to
```
http://localhost:4000
```

To update the live website, simply push changes to the github repository,
github takes care to rebuild the site.
